Automatically change the date of multiple entries in Day view.

When stopping timers, the values are all added to the current day. Oftentimes, I stop timers after midnight—either a few minutes after or the next morning. If I performed many tasks the prior day, it is tedious to move all of the entries over. This provides a new “Move All” button which, while clunky, speeds up that process.
